You can do the following to run the compiled frontend code on your local machine:

```cd dist```  
```python -m SimpleHTTPServer```

Note that this will only work on the *compiled* frontend code. If you would like to
make changes to the frontend code, follow the installation guide.

If you run into build errors, try running ```bower install``` from the frontend's
root directory (likely this one).
